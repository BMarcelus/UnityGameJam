"Please Touch the Artwork"


"Don't touch the paintings", his mother said on their way to the art walk.
But maybe the little boy misheard it as "Touch the paintings" because he decides to wreck havoc on the newly opened Art Exhibition.
His mission: touch every piece of painting he can. After all, it is the best way to experience art.
Neither the guards nor his mother can stop him from becoming the next art critic.
