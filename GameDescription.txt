"Art Run"


"Don't touch the paintings", his mother said on their way to the art walk.
But the little boy decides to wreck havoc during the event of the newly opened Art Exhibition.
His mission: touch every piece of painting he can. After all, it is the best way to experience art.
Neither the guards nor his mother can stop him from becoming the next art critic.
